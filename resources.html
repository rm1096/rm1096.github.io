		<b><a href="http://www.robpercival.co.uk/about/">Rob Percival</a></b> - I've been learning from him for a little more than a year, and owe most of my knowledge to him. I'm currently enrolled in his courses, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/">"The Complete Web Developer Course"</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-apple-watch-developer-course/">"The Complete Apple Watch Developer Course"</a> on Udemy. He actually inspired me to create a webpage for myself!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a></b> - This website is popular for a reason. Check them out, because they most likely have the solutions to any problem you have! 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="http://www.sevensignature.com/blog/">7Signature</a></b> - A fellow developer runs this site. He defintely helped me with specific obstacles I had in creating this website!
