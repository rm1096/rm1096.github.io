	<p> Brief introduction, my name is <b>Raphaelle Marcial</b>! Rutgers University is my second home, and I'm a third-year computer engineering major. Please feel free to look around, and contact me!</p>

<h2> About </h2>

	<p>Collaboration motivates me.</p>

	<p>While independence is important for my introverted lifestyle, I insist that bouncing ideas off others is key in creating giant leaps. This belief stems from seeing how innovators throughout history were able to evolve the computer into what it is today in such a short period of time. Even though achievements occur rapidly in technology, over 5 billion people still don't have access to the internet. My goal is to be part of a team who changes this.</p>

	<p>When I'm not thrown into my work, I like to watch romantic comedies and go on long runs. </p>
	
	<p>While I still deem myself as a beginner in the coding languages I practice, I am familiar with C++ and Xcode. Also, I have some knowledge in HTML and CSS (or else I wouldn't be able to create this website).</p>

	This was my final project from 14:332:252 - Programming Methodology 1. Students were asked to complete segments of code resulting in a replica of the game "Snake". Clearly, I was very excited upon completing this (via Snapchat). <a href="https://github.com/rm1096/Snake-Demo/commit/8c08d42f7ab3ee24d2355c68bcd0d3194618ccb8">Click here</a> for the code utilized in creating this!

		This is a screenshot of the first Apple Watch App I've created through Udemy. It was a guessing game where the user would input a number from 1 to 5 and see if the computer "thought" of the same number. <a href="https://github.com/rm1096/How-Many-Fingers">Here</a> is the code for How Many Fingers!

		Learning how to code is a task which the majority of us do outside of an academic environment. Therefore, it wouldn't feel right continuing my journey without giving credit:
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b><a href="http://www.robpercival.co.uk/about/">Rob Percival</a></b> - I've been learning from him for a little more than a year, and owe most of my knowledge to him. I'm currently enrolled in his courses, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/">"The Complete Web Developer Course"</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-apple-watch-developer-course/">"The Complete Apple Watch Developer Course"</a> on Udemy. He actually inspired me to create a webpage for myself!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a></b> - This website is popular for a reason. Check them out, because they most likely have the solutions to any problem you have! 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b><a href="http://www.sevensignature.com/blog/">7Signature</a></b> - A fellow developer runs this site. He defintely helped me with specific obstacles I had in creating this website!
