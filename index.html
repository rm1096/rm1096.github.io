	<h2>Where Can I Find ____?</h2>
<br>
	<p>This section probably isn't necessary since everything is basically self - explanatory, but in case you wanted a proper guide...</p>
	<p><i>About</i> - Find out more about who I am, and look at my resume.</p>
	<p><i>Portfolio</i> - A collection of programs I have completed either through school or independently.
		I included links of each to my <a href="https://github.com/rm1096">GitHub</a>, for your pleasure.</p>
	<p><i>Blog</i> - Periodic updates on my life.</p>
	<p><i>Resources</i> - I threw together a list of places where I learned my craft in order to make this site along with other projects. I also give credit to people in this section.</p>
	<p><i>Let's Connect!</i> - Now you can get a hold of me whenever and wherever! </p>
