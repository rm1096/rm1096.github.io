	<h2><b>About</b></h2>
	<p>Hey again! This was adopted from my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelle-marcial-43b87a112">LinkedIn</a> summary:
		
	<p>Collaboration motivates me.</p>

	<p>While independence is important for my introverted lifestyle, I insist that bouncing ideas off others is key in creating giant leaps. This belief stems from seeing how innovators throughout history were able to evolve the computer into what it is today in such a short period of time. Even though achievements occur rapidly in technology, over 5 billion people still don't have access to the internet. My goal is to be part of a team who changes this.</p>

	<p>When I'm not thrown into my work, I like to watch romantic comedies and go on long runs. </p>
	
	<p>While I still deem myself as a beginner in the coding languages I practice, I am familiar with C++ and Xcode. Also, I have some knowledge in HTML and CSS (or else I wouldn't be able to create this website).</p>
