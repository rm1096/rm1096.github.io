Alright, so a few things. Junior year has begun, and it is taking a toll on me. This summer, I did not relearn C++ nor get experience with Arduino (yes, I slacked). BUT I just watched an YouTube video which motivated me to get on my game because I really need this internship (pls hire me). I now have my resume uploaded, so you can get a better feel of who I am. My LinkedIn is not updated yet, but I'm getting on that too! As always, the email is always open, I'm bound to be on social media, and I'm down to talk!

I did not lie when I said these updates would be periodic... Since my sophomore year just ended, I now have more time to devote to this website and other projects. For this summer, I plan to take summer classes in order to catch up with school work. Also, I'm working again because I didn't land an internship. However, not all hope is lost because I got a research opportunity for next year! If you want to know more details about it, contact me. My goals for this summer are to relearn C++ and to get some experience with Arduino. I just bought an Arduino Uno the other day, so if anyone has advice/resources let me know! Back to work!

First post on this website! Even though this page still has a long way to go design wise, I'm pleased with the progress I've made so far. I've been developing "collaboraphtion" a few hours every day for more than a week, but I've always had the idea to make a website. I never got around to doing it until now! This is probably because I'm starting to apply to internships and I needed a medium to show recruiters my work... Anyway, this is just the beginning for this website and me. Hopefully, I maintain this drive as this is still the beginning of the semester. Back to work!
