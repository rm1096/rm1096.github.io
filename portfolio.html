	This was my final project from 14:332:252 - Programming Methodology 1. Students were asked to complete segments of code resulting in a replica of the game "Snake". Clearly, I was very excited upon completing this (via Snapchat). <a href="https://github.com/rm1096/Snake-Demo/commit/8c08d42f7ab3ee24d2355c68bcd0d3194618ccb8">Click here</a> for the code utilized in creating this!

		This is a screenshot of the first Apple Watch App I've created through Udemy. It was a guessing game where the user would input a number from 1 to 5 and see if the computer "thought" of the same number. <a href="https://github.com/rm1096/How-Many-Fingers">Here</a> is the code for How Many Fingers!
